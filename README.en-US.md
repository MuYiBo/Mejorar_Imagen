## Features
After uploading an image, it enlarges the resolution while enhancing the clarity, supporting a maximum enlargement of **10 times**. For example, a 500x500 image may appear blurry when used in certain scenarios due to low resolution. By enlarging it 10 times to 5000x5000 pixels, the image will appear much clearer in the same scenario. This tool is useful for designers, photographers, social media content creators, and more.

## Highlights

- Compared to most tools that can enlarge resolution up to 4K, we can enlarge up to **12K**;
- Using AI, it significantly improves image clarity while enlarging the resolution;
